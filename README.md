- 👋 Hi, I’m Lucian :)
- 👀 I’m interested in technology in the NGO space, using data in the decision making process, A.I. ethical applications, teaching, and research, as well as art and science and related transformational studies.
- 🌱 I’m currently working as a team lead and product owner of one of the largest NGO databases in the world and teaching coding and data exploration to students from an applied arts university in the department of cross-disciplinary strategies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects related to my interests.
